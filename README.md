## Autoencoder Neural Network
In this project I built an autoencoder neural network using *Keras* to forecast failure in a four bearing system using [NASA Acoustics and Vibration Database](http://data-acoustics.com/measurements/bearing-faults/bearing-4/) that contains three sets of data. Each data is consisting of four bearings which had been run under constant running condition to failure. Here, second test's data is used to train the autoencoder NN model. Once you download the [database](http://ti.arc.nasa.gov/c/3/), you can get more details on the conducted vibration experiments and the structure of data through reading the *Readme* file attached to it.
